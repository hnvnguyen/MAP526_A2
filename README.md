This is a Xamarin cross-platform app for helping the user to get access to a list of planetary bodies inside of our Solar System.

All planetary bodiesâ€™ basic information is retrieved from The Solar System OpenData API; and the random cosmic image is through the connection with NASA Open API (Astronomy Picture of the Day).
